            "Extremely professional. Go out of there way to make things look great! They are very reasonable price wise. I would ask for Patrick if you want things to move quickly and smoothly! However all employees are just as kind and helpful. Nothing 
            like coral cleaning services! Great job guys look forward to using this service again I give it a 10 out of 10."

            separated between the kids and adults. Highly recommend!"

            "They lost my trousers and ignored all of my emails asking them about this. If they had responded I would not have given them this review as I understand things get lost but I think the true value of a company is how they react when things 
            go wrong. They charge a lot more than local companies but I was willing to pay that as the reviews were so positive. They hold themselves out as being a cut above but ignoring a customer is clearly not acceptable. Very very disappointed."

            "I just did their pick up service. Best money I spent all year. They came to my door picked up the laundry on time and texted me 5 minutes before they came and delivered back the very next day texting me again 5 minutes before them came and 
            again on time. Everything was folded perfectly and professionally. I did not know what to expect and honestly was blown away. I did this because I am in my busiest time of the year for my business and the community laundry in our complex broke.
            So I did not have the time to go to the laundry mat but would gladly do it again. I normally do the laundry and they did such a better job than I ever did. They put my laundry skills, or lack of, to shame. Also their delivery guys were super 
            nice and professional. Can't say enough good things about this service saved me hours. Its just laundry but honestly made my day. So we will use them again. Thanks so much."

            "I had let my laundry pile up and decided to send it out. I decided on coral laundry as their web sight was user friendly, prices reasonable, they do pick up and delivery and offered a discount for first time customers. My laundry was picked up 
            and delivered on time and nicely packaged. I had a billing issue and it was resolved promptly. Since I didn't have the opportunity to put away my clean laundry for a couple of days I assumed a lot of it would be wrinkled. I don't know their 
            secret, but everything was folded so beautifully and stacked just right in the bags that wrinkles were very minimal. The socks were even together with paper bands. The towels are fluffy and folded perfectly, just beautiful! I am very happy 
            with their service and will be using them again. Highly recommend."

            "We used Coral Cleaning this past weekend as our dryer has been broken for over a week and cannot be repaired until next week. I wasn't really sure what to expect as the pricing seemed reasonable and the timing perfect. Let me tell you... 
            our laundry was picked up on time as scheduled. I received text notifications throughout the entire process. Our clothes were delivered and left on the porch as promised on time. The folding was impressive and our laundry smelt fantastic. I even 
            had a billing issue and Betty fixed it immediately. They website to schedule the services is pretty user friendly. I would definitely recommend their services and will be using them in the future after trips, if our dryer breaks again, or 
            when I'm just being lazy."

            AMAZING! I found this place while searching for an auto-detailing place near me and I luckily found this one. Rick was able to fit me in within a week of calling him. It was done so fast and my car looks amazing. 
            It looks and smells like a brand new car. Rick did a fantastic job and I will definitely be returning when my car needs detailing. Thank you so much!

            Rick really brought my Volkswagen Tiguan to life! The maple trees on my property really ruined the paint on my vehicle due to the excessive amount of sap that had fallen on the surface. I was worried that the damage 
            couldn't be undone because the sap that had accumulated had harden over time. Rick not only removed the sap… he was able to remove the sap without further damage to the paint! When I picked up my car, it was beautifully 
            polished and looked like a brand new vehicle in a showroom! Amazing!!! THANK YOU!

            Wow! I would swear Rick traded my car in for a brand new model!! It hasn’t looked this good since I drove it off of the dealership lot 9 years ago. Thanks!!!

            Our new garden was full of potential but had seriously got out of hand, blocking out light to the house. Bob cut back and cleared it all, bringing it back to a manageable level. It has made such a difference. Gave expert advice on maintenance. 
            All rubbish taken away and worked on through the rain. Quoted price and no hidden surprises at the end. Would not hesitate to recommend.

            We are delighted by the work carried out by Glynn and his assistant.  Nothing was too much trouble for them.. They willingly adjusted something if we weren’t happy with.  Our garden looks so much better since their visit.
