                    Having a leather sofa, a chair or a whole set of leather upholstered furniture brings comfort, style and class to your home, vehicle or office that are unrivalled by none other types of upholstery. 
                    But with those benefits, the leather owning brings responsibility - it needs to be handled with care, by an experienced hand, so it could maintain its original properties extending the life-span of your sofa.

                    Although leather pieces of furniture are well known for their durability, they also need attention and regular cleaning. One of the negative aspects of leather sofas is that they absorb oil and sweat from your body.
